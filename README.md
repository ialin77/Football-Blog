# Football-Blog
Footbal-Blog is a very simple blog dedidcated for the most hot news from the world of fooball. For the PMS website, I used Python for all functionalities, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.

Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the Football-Blog.

The applications that make up the project are the following:

• Core - this is the main application of the project where is stored the main template for the front page of the Football-Blog wich display all post and their details such as title, subtitle, category, and the date when was created, and the Django template for the front page.

• Blog - this is the second app of the project where I integrated the functionalities such as viewing the details of the post, searching a post or a category. The last functionality created is the posiblity to add comments at a post.


Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates used in this project weren't created by me and the website design wasn't a priority for me, I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
